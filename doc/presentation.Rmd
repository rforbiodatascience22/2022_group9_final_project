## Introduction: Breast Cancer

Prevalence: 12% in women.

Mortality rate: 2,7%.

Symptoms: little to no before it is widespread

Tumor types: (Vary in location, size, shape and severity)

- Basal-like
- HER2-enriched
- Luminal A
- Luminal B


## Materials: Data

Data Origin

- ???

The raw data consist of 3 datasets:

- "patients": Describes patients on 29 variables (105 cancer patients)
- "proteomes": States the protein expression of 12553 genes for each patient (77 cancer patients, 3 dublicates and 3 healthy)
- "PAM50": Database that describes each gene further


## Methods: modifications

Merged: ("patients" + "proteomes")

- "BC_Data": Describes patients on 29 variables and the protein expression of 12553 genes (77 cancer patients)

Argumentation:

- changed X from characters to 1's and 0's


## Investigating the cancer types

Age is a significant survival factor for the Luminal breast cancers


## introduction

-this dataset contains 77 patients' and 3 health samples.
-After cleaned it we merged the 3 data and plot all the attributes based on their subtypes.and then we decide to select some of the attributes and do PCA to see if the attribute is related to it's subtype devision.
