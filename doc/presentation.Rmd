## Introduction: Breast Cancer

Prevalence: 12% in women.

Mortality rate: 2,7%.

Symptoms: little to no before it is widespread

Tumor types: (Vary in location, size, shape and severity)

- Basal-like
- HER2-enriched
- Luminal A
- Luminal B

## Presenting Data

## aim

Breast cancer is found to have 4 subtypes at gene expression level and they can be detected by using a panel of 50 genes, namely the “PAM50”. In this project we will look at cancer patients with 4 subtypes, try to cluster the samples by using different sets of protein expression data, and evaluate the clustering results to see if the PAM50 gene list makes the most sense.

** take a look at later **


## Methods: Data Modifications and analysis

## Discussion

- only half is explained by the clustering
- Data lacks non cancer cases.
- reproducability
