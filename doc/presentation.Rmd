## Introduction: Breast Cancer

- Prevalence: 12% in women.
- Mortality rate: 2,7%.
- Symptoms: little to no before it is widespread
- 4 Tumor types: Vary in location, size, shape and severity

## Aim

Breast cancer is found to have 4 subtypes at gene expression level and they can be detected by using a panel of 50 genes, namely the “PAM50”. In this project we will look at cancer patients with 4 subtypes, try to cluster the samples by using different sets of protein expression data, and evaluate the clustering results to see if the PAM50 gene list makes the most sense.

** take a look at later **

We are investigating whether the 4 subtypes can be detected and classified correctly by the gene expression Using the proteomic data.

## Discussion

- only half is explained by the clustering
- Data lacks non cancer cases.
- reproducability
