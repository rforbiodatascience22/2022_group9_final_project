## Introduction: Breast Cancer

Prevalence: 12% in women.

Mortality rate: 2,7%.

Symptoms: little to no before it is widespread

Tumor types: (Vary in location, size, shape and severity)

- Basal-like
- HER2-enriched
- Luminal A
- Luminal B


## Materials: Data

Data Origin

The raw datasets:

- "patients": 105 cancer patients, 29 variables
- "proteomes": protein expression of 12553 genes for 77 cancer patients, 3 duplicates and 3 healthy.
- "PAM50": Describes each gene further


## Presenting Data

![](../results/04_plot_AgeVitalCancerType.png){width=99%}


## Methods: Data Modifications

Data modifications
- Merging: ("patients" + "proteomes")
- "BC_Data": Describes patients on 29 variables and the protein expression of 12553 genes (77 cancer patients)

Argumentation:
- changed X from characters to 1's and 0's

## Methods: Analysis

GLM on each Breast Cancer Type

Venn-diagram to observe common genes

Gene expression profiling of the common genes

common genes with PAM50 Dataset

PCA and clustering

## Results: Common genes after GLM

PCA

-this dataset contains 77 patients' and 3 health samples.
-After cleaned it we merged the 3 data and plot all the attributes based on their subtypes.and then we decide to select some of the attributes and do PCA to see if the attribute is related to it's subtype devision.
