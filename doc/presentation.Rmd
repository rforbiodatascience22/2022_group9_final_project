## Introduction

- <font size="4"> Prevalence: 12% in women (CITE) </font>
- <font size="4"> Mortality rate: 2.7% (CITE) </font>
- <font size="4"> Symptoms: little to no before it is widespread </font>
- <font size="4"> 4 Tumor types: Vary in location, size, shape and severity </font>

## Aim

<font size="4"> Breast cancer is found to have 4 subtypes at gene expression level and they can be detected by using a panel of 50 genes, namely the “PAM50”. In this project we will look at cancer patients with 4 subtypes, try to cluster the samples by using different sets of protein expression data, and evaluate the clustering results to see if the PAM50 gene list makes the most sense. </font>

** take a look at later **

<font size="4"> We are investigating whether the 4 subtypes can be detected and classified correctly by the gene expression Using the proteomic data. </font>



## Materials and Methods

<font size="1">Mertins, P., Mani, D., Ruggles, K. et al. Proteogenomics connects somatic mutations to signalling in breast cancer. Nature 534, 55–62 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/nature18003</font>


## Results - Common proteins after GLM
- <font size="4"> Still found 1000 more significant proteins in each subtype after `glm()` </font>
- <font size="4"> `ggvenn()` </font>
- <font size="4"> Only 24 significant proteins were founded in all 4 subtypes </font>

## Results - Common proteins after GLM
- <font size="4"> LumA and B look more similar, while Basal and Her2 look more similar. </font>
- <font size="4"> Within each heat map, protein expression levels between each patient are also similar. </font>

## Results - Common Protein BC Data
- <font size="4"> The first 17 PCs were chosen for clustering. </font>
- <font size="4"> Cluster distributions are not similar to subtype distributions. </font>
- <font size="4"> Accuracy: 16.9% </font>

## Results - Original BC data

![](../results/07_BC_data_cumulative_kmeans.png){width=99%}

- <font size="4"> Number of PCA reduced from 77 to 65 </font>
- <font size="4"> No clear patterns </font>
- <font size="4"> Little of the variance is explained by PC1 and PC2 </font>
- <font size="4"> Accuracy of plot: 36.4% </font>


## Results - Protein IDs common between PAM50 data and BC data


![](../results/07_BC_data_PAM50_cumulative_kmeans.png){width=99%}

- <font size="4"> Number of PCA reduced from 26 to 15 </font>
- <font size="4"> 1st PC explains a much higher variance (34.9% compared to 10.7%) </font>
- <font size="4"> Accuracy of this exact plot: 48.1% </font>



## Discussion

- only half is explained by the clustering
- Data lacks non cancer cases.
- reproducability
